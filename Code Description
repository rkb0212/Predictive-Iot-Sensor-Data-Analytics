Code Block 1: Importing Libraries
python
Copy
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, mean_squared_error
Purpose:

Imports all necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning

Key libraries include:

pandas and numpy for data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

sklearn modules for machine learning tasks (data splitting, preprocessing, models, and evaluation)

Code Block 2: Loading Data
python
Copy
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00601/ai4i2020.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)
Purpose:

Loads the predictive maintenance dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

The dataset contains sensor data from industrial machines with failure indicators

Stores the data in a pandas DataFrame named data

Code Block 3: Displaying Data Head
python
Copy
data.head()
Purpose:

Shows the first 5 rows of the dataset to get a quick overview

Reveals columns like:

UDI: Unique identifier

Product ID

Type: Machine type (L, M, H)

Sensor measurements (air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear)

Machine failure indicator (binary)

Failure type indicators (TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF)

Code Block 4: Checking Missing Values
python
Copy
print("Missing Values:\n", data.isnull().sum())
Purpose:

Checks for missing/null values in the dataset

Output shows no missing values in any column (all counts are 0)

Important for data quality assessment before analysis

Code Block 5: Summary Statistics
python
Copy
print("\nSummary Statistics:\n", data.describe())
Purpose:

Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns

Shows count, mean, std, min, max, and quartiles

Key observations:

Machine failure rate is low (3.39% of samples)

Sensor measurements have different scales that may need normalization

Most failure type indicators are rare (all < 1.5% occurrence)

Code Block 6: Visualizing Sensor Trends
python
Copy
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.pairplot(data[['Process temperature [K]', 'Rotational speed [rpm]',
                   'Torque [Nm]', 'Tool wear [min]', 'Machine failure']],
             hue='Machine failure', palette='viridis')
plt.title("Sensor Readings vs Machine Failure")
plt.show()
Purpose:

Creates a pairplot visualization showing relationships between sensor measurements

Colors points by machine failure status (0=no failure, 1=failure)

Helps identify:

Potential correlations between variables

Differences in sensor readings between failed/non-failed machines

Outliers or unusual patterns in the data
